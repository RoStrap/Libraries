# Libraries
A list of Libraries for RoStrap and a guide on contributing.

When you use RoStrap, you are using tested and tried Libraries which are continually **maintained** by the best developers in town! Whenever a developer updates their Library on GitHub, you will see an update button appear (under the `INSTALLED` tab).

Updates are detected when your source code doesn't match the source code of the latest version of GitHub, excluding whitespace, comments, and configurable variables. Configurable variables have to look like this:

```lua
local ALL_CAMEL_CASE = "SINGLE-LINE-VALUE"
```
